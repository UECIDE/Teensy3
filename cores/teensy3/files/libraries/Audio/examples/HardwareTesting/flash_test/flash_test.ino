NOTES
  - this assumes that the page number referenced in page_number
    has been erased. If it hasn't, the read_back will be incorrect.
  - do not panic when the serial monitor outputs a whole series
of 255 at the end. This correct! scroll back to the beginning of the
output. It shoud like this:

Status = 0
EF, 40, 18, 0, 

Write Page 0xFFFF
time (us) = 814

Read Page 0xFFFF
time (us) = 429
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
.
.
.
etc.

It reads and prints the chip's status and then its ID.
Then it writes 0,1,2,3,...,254,255 into a 256 bytes buffer and writes
that into page_number on the chip. It then reads that back, so that
the output should be 0,1,2,3,...,254,255 (one per line). It then
erases the sector containing that page and times the operation.
You should see something like this:

Erase sector
time (us) = 90315

Read Page 0xFFFF
time (us) = 424
255
255
255
.
.
.

It should report that everything is 255 because the sector
(and the page) have been erased.

  c
  - Change name to flash_test for release
  
  b
  - fix references to flash_read_page to flash_read_pages
    and flash_read_fast_page to flash_read_pages (the library
    now uses the fast method all the time).
  - remove last segment which does another read fast - obsolete.

  a
  - read the ID
  - write 256 bytes to a page and then read them back.
  - erase the sector and read the page again - works
  
  On Teensy 3 there is/was a problem with SPI
